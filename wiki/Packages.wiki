#summary packages in Maashaack

= Introduction =

== About naming packages ==

We do not believe in the classic `com.companyName.productName`<br>
convention to apply to a general framework naming system.

Long time ago (AS2 times) someone tried to create the "!ActionScript Standard Library" (ASL)<br>
but that's not what we are trying to do (a standard library).

Some other people use `org.osflash.libraryName` but considering the state of osflash,<br>
even if we are pro open source we don't think our code belong in this naming.

*maashaack* is merely a pun or a joke as a name<br>
(we don't take ourselves seriously but we *DO* take code seriously)<br>
so we didn't feel either to use `org.maashaack.framework`.

In some cases, we could reuse the package *flash.something*<br>
but we are afraid that maybe Adobe will make us change it.
(they did it by telling *flashobject* to change their name, see [http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/history swfobject history])

The following describe the different *root* packages and their scope.
