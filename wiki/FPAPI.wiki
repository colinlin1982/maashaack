#summary about the Flash Platform API.

== Introduction ==

*FPAPI* stands for the *Flash Platform API*.

It allows us to refer to the *Flash Player API* (FP API)
and/or the *Adobe Integrated Runtime API* (AIR API)
in our/your usage of the AS3 language.

We will mention the *FPAPI* mainly to inform with
which version of Flash and/or AIR a particular
package or library or tool etc. can works.


== Details ==

Here how the *FPAPI* versioning works:

  * anything starting with *FP_* works with the *Flash Player*<br/>and will also work with AIR
  * anything starting with *AIR_* works with the *Adobe Integrated Runtime*<br/>but will not necessary work with the Flash player
  * if no *FPAPI* is mentioned we default to *FP_9_0*
  * a change of API version can introduce languages features, SWF features, etc.
  * refer to the table bellow to see which is compatible with what
