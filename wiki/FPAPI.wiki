#summary about the Flash Platform API.

== Introduction ==

*FPAPI* stands for the *Flash Platform API*.

It allows us to refer to the *Flash Player API* (FP API)
and/or the *Adobe Integrated Runtime API* (AIR API)
in our/your usage of the AS3 language.

We will mention the *FPAPI* mainly to inform with
which version of Flash and/or AIR a particular
package or library or tool etc. can works.


== Details ==

Here how the *FPAPI* versioning works:

  * anything starting with *FP_* works with the *Flash Player*<br/>and will also work with AIR
  * anything starting with *AIR_* works with the *Adobe Integrated Runtime*<br/>but will not necessary work with the Flash player
  * if no *FPAPI* is mentioned we default to *FP_9_0*
  * a change of API version can introduce languages features, SWF features, etc.
  * refer to the table bellow to see which is compatible with what

Our advice is when you start to implement something
simply base it on the current stable *FPAPI*.

If you need backward compatibility with earlier version,
then use [ConditionalCompilation condition compilation]
and works your way back in the code.

*note:*
  * after Flash Player 10.2, SWF version got incremented for each dot release
  * SWF version is the minimum SWF version supported in the Flex SDK
  * AIR SDK is the version provided by default in the Flex SDK
  * bold is the last stable version
  * version after last stable is current beta

=== Examples ===

If your class depends on *FPAPI* *FP_10_2* (Flash Player 10.2)
  * it will also works with *AIR_2_6* (AIR 2.6)
  * and any successive version of Flash Player (10.3, 11, 11.1, etc.)
  * and any successive version of AIR (2.7, 3.0, 3.1, etc.)

if your class depends on *FPAPI* *AIR_3_3* (AIR 3.3)
  * it will not work with *FP_11_3* (Flash Player 11.3)
  * it will work with any successive version of AIR (3.4, 3.5, etc.)
