#summary about the Flash C++ Compiler.

== Introduction ==

<pre>
Previously codenamed "Alchemy," the Flash C++ Compiler provides
a complete BSD-like C/C++ development environment based on GCC
that lets you compile your C/C++ code to target
the Adobe Flash Runtimes (Flash Player and AIR).

With flascc you can port almost any existing C/C++ code to the web, across browsers.

Flascc includes tools for building, testing, and debugging C/C++ projects,
example projects with source code, and documentation.
