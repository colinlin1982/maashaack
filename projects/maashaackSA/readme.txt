maashaack-SA
============

The Maashaack Stand Alone (SA) projects are the result of many years
of open source collaboration and sharing between Marc (ekameleon) and Zwetan.

We both had our own "utils libraries" then we decided to join forces,
learn and share about how to organise, build and grow an open source project.

The motivation came from the ActionScript ecosystem, on one side you had
a lot of MVC frameworks, on the other side you had the Flash API, and last
but not least, from its ECMAScript nature there were not a proper
application framework for AS3, so we decided to build it and do it right.

To this day, we are still using many parts of those packages or libraries
in every single applications we are building either for ourselves or for client works.


Mission Statement
-----------------
The maashaack projects only purpose is to provide portable
cross-platform and standard packages, libraries and tools,
for the Flash Platform and the AS3 language.


maashaack application framework
-------------------------------
is a set of different modular projects assembled together
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, functions and packages
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".

maashaack libraries
-------------------
are independent modules which focus on one particular set of problem,
they fit the need of "programming in the small".

maashaack tools
---------------
are executable tools in relation with the AS3 language and/or the Flash Platform
their goal is to cover small area not covered by much bigger tools (like the Flex SDK).

maashaack documentation
-----------------------
focus mainly on the use of the different frameworks, classes, libraries, etc.
but also try to assemble the best ressources related to AS3 and Flash/AIR development in general.
